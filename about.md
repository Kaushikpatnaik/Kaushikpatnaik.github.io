I am a CS graduate, specializing in Machine Learning, currently working as a Data Scientist at [Orbital Insight](https://www.orbitalinsight.com/) on Computer Vision. Previously, I spent two years at [$Element Analytics$](https://www.elementanalytics.com/) working on Industrial IoT problems like time to failure, forecasting etc.

One of my self challenges for increasing knowledge and expertise in machine learning is to build and share my paper readings/notes, and personal projects. This blog aims to be a repository containing such material. I am challenging myself to post weekly. This is not necessarily a deep learning focussed blog, although now a days most of ML is taken to be that way.

All opinions on this site are mine alone.
