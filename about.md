I am a CS graduate, specializing in Machine Learning, currently working as a Data Scientist at [Orbital Insight](https://www.orbitalinsight.com/). Previously, I spent two years at [$Element Analytics$](https://www.elementanalytics.com/) working on Industrial IoT problems like time to failure, forecasting etc.

One of my self challenges for increasing my knowledge and expertise in machine learning is to build and share my paper readings/notes, personal projects and hacks. This blog aims to be a repository containing such material. I am challenging myself to weekly paper summary blog posts and monthly project updates. I will post reference to materials as necessary. This is not necessarily a deep learning focussed blog, although now a days most of ML is taken to be that way.

This blog will contain material around:
* Sequence Learning
* Reinforcement Learning
* NLP
* Unsupervised Learning

All opinions on this site are mine alone.

This site was created using Jekyll and github pages, using the minima theme. To learn more about them visit:{% include icon-github.html username="jekyll" %}[jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
