I am a CS graduate, specializing in Machine Learning, currently working as a Data Scientist at [Element Analytics](https://www.elementanalytics.com/).

One of my self challenges for increasing my knowledge and expertise in machine learning is to build and share my paper readings/notes, personal projects and hacks. This blog aims to be a repository containing such material. I am challenging myself to weekly paper summary blog posts and monthly project updates. 

This blog will contain material around:
* Sequence Learning (including time series)
* Reinforcement Learning
* NLP
* Unsupervised Learning

All opinions on this site are mine alone.

This site was created using Jekyll and github pages, using the minima theme. To learn more about them visit:{% include icon-github.html username="jekyll" %}[jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
